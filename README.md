# Kid Clock

This was a quick project to teach myself AngularJS.

It also runs as a clock in my kid's room.

It's configurable as to how much detail to show the kid -- hours, minutes, seconds, AM/PM can be turned on/off.

It changes colors so kids who don't understand numbers can look at the color and know if it's time to wake up.

The UI for setting the times when the colors change isn't done yet.  Feel free to help me finish it!
